The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This style should override the previous ones */
}

/* However, if we introduce an inline style:
   This overrides the specificity of the div p selector. */
<div><p style="color:purple">This text will be purple.</p></div>
```
This happens because inline styles have the highest specificity, overriding any other styles applied to the element.
