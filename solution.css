One way to manage this situation is to be mindful of inline styles and avoid them unless absolutely necessary. Alternatively, you can use more specific selectors or the `!important` flag (but use this very cautiously) to override the inline style.

Example using a more specific selector:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div > p {
  color: green; /* More specific selector overriding inline style */
}

/* Or with !important (use sparingly): */
div p {
  color: green !important; 
}
```
However, remember that overuse of `!important` can lead to difficult-to-maintain CSS.
